# anime-recommender-system
This project was a teamwork with my teammate [@alireza-dehghan-nayeri](https://github.com/alireza-dehghan-nayeri)
## Description

This project is my final project for the Information Retrieval course and is written in Python. The aim of this project is to develop an anime recommendation system that suggests the best animes for users to watch.

The project includes two files: one for implementing [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) and another for implementing content-based filtering. The collaborative filtering algorithm recommends new animes to users based on their ratings of previously watched animes, while the content-based filtering algorithm suggests animes based on the characteristics and attributes of the animes the user has watched.

The dataset used in the project has undergone preprocessing to ensure its suitability for the recommendation algorithms.
